## 📖 Overview

The final projects use different technologies to create interactive graphics and visualizations. 
All of them are based on web technologies, allowing them to be run in a web browser:

- **C2D**: A project using the Canvas 2D API to create a 2D scene with a boat and a following object.
- **SVG**: A project using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) to create a 2D game.
- **X3D**: A project using X3D to create a 3D scene with a ferris wheel.
- **3JS**: A project using Three.js to create a small animation with a given word as the main focus.
